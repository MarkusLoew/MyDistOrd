Description: Re-orders a symmetric additive relationship matrix (created by, for example,  \code{sommer::A.mat} in the same way as \code{stats::heatmap()} does. It does not create the associated heatmap or dendrograms and is therefore suitable for large matrices. It's a convenience function to automate the necessary cluster and dendrogram creation to calculate the order.
